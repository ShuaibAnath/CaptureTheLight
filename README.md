# Capture The Light

There are 4 levels of this game. This is a game where a single LED is first lit at random, this LED indicates which LED is the one that must be ‘captured’, known as the target LED. The game setup has an array of identical LEDs with a single pushbutton (Hardware setup is done using Wokwi and code is meant for use on Arduino Uno). At each level the objective is to capture the target LED, to do this the user must press a button when the target LED is lit. After lighting the target LED the game begins with a specific number of LEDs being lit at random one by one at a certain speed (the number of LEDs lit is based on the level the player is playing). If the user presses the button while the target LED is not lit, they lose the game and must restart. When the target LED is lit the user must press the pushbutton, at this point the user completes the level successfully and the LEDs are lit in a certain sequence if the user successfully presses the button fast enough (the sequence shows the player that the level has been completed and the target LED has been successfully ‘captured’), it is then be indicated to the user that the next level will start using a different lighting sequence for the LEDs. The levels increase in difficulty by the random lighting of the LEDs increasing in speed and variability until the user finishes the game at the final level.
